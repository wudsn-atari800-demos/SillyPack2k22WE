Info:    Mono

Tools:   Chaos Music Composer (CMC)


This is part of my mono music discs
pentalogy. Music used here is from
1993 - 1999. With the exception of
the Dorgaster collection, which
contains music from 2006 - 2022
(the newest mono CMC).



All music was composed in CMC editor
on a real Atari. I wanted to close my
mono CMC work with these collections.
It's not really competition stuff,
but more for fun :) The complete set
will be published on Atariage after
SV2022 WE.

Dorgaster
Malastor
Reguskor

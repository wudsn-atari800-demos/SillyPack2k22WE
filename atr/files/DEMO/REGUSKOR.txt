This is part of my mono music discs pentalogy. Music used here is from 1993 - 1999. With the exception of the Dorgaster collection, which contains music from 2006 - 2022 (the newest mono CMC). All music is composed in CMC editor on a real Atari. I wanted to close my mono CMC work with these collections. It's not really a competition stuff, but more for fun :) The complete set will be published on AA after SV2022 WE.

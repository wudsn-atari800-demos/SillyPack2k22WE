Arsantica 0 - the rough cut
---------------------------

Platform: Atari XL/XE 64kb 
Compo: Atari Demo

Code: Heaven
Music: BeWu

This is the early prototype of Arsantica 1 demo with
some alternative music which was later replaced in
the final version. Some parts missing here and it is
not polished. so it is basicly a rough first version.

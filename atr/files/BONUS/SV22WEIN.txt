A small invitation for "Sillyventure
2022 winter edition", held up between
December 8th - 11th, 2022 in Gdansk.
All infos will flush up at:

Based on the great sv22se logo by
mOOnie, I adapted it to a8 and then
made the sv22we logo out of this
conversion. The tool used for this
was g2f by TeBe. For the sprites, I
used great web tools by Bocianu.

The RMT music is played back with
lzss code based on routines by dmsc.

All assembling works are done using
WUDSN IDE by JAC! and thus used MADS
Assembler by TeBe. Thanks for all
your work, folks!
